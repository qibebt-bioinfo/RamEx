\title{Polynomial fitting for spectral baseline correction}
\usage{
polyfit(spectra, t, degree = 4, tol = 0.001, rep = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectra}{A matrix of spectral data where each row represents a spectrum.}

\item{t}{A numeric vector of x-values for the polynomial fitting. If missing or FALSE,
a sequence from 1 to the number of columns in `spectra` is used.}

\item{degree}{The degree of the polynomial to fit.}

\item{tol}{The tolerance for convergence of the iterative fitting process.}

\item{rep}{The maximum number of iterations to perform.}
}
\value{
A list containing the baseline and the corrected spectra.
}
\description{
This function performs polynomial fitting to correct the baseline of spectral data.
It iteratively fits a polynomial to the data, ensuring that the fitted values
do not exceed the original data values.
