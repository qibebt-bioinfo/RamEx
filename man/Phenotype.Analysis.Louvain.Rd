\usage{
Phenotype.Analysis.Louvain(
  object,
  resolutions,
  n_pc = 10,
  threshold = 0.001,
  k = 30,
  n_tree = 50,
  prune.SNN = 1/15,
  seed = 42,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A Ramanome object.}

\item{resolutions}{Numeric vector of resolution values to evaluate.}

\item{n_pc}{Number of principal components used to build the neighbor graph.}

\item{threshold}{Minimum cluster size. Values < 1 are treated as the fraction
of cells and values >= 1 are treated as absolute counts.}

\item{k}{Number of nearest neighbors per cell when constructing the k-NN
graph. Larger values encourage coarser clusters.}

\item{n_tree}{Number of trees used by the Annoy index.}

\item{prune.SNN}{Pruning threshold applied when computing the SNN Jaccard
similarity matrix.}

\item{seed}{Seed used to make the Louvain results reproducible.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print progress messages.}
}
\value{
A data frame whose columns contain the Louvain cluster labels for
each requested resolution.
}
\description{
Build a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph from the latest spectral matrix
stored in a Ramanome object and run Louvain community detection across a
vector of resolution values.
