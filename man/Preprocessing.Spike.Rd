\alias{Preprocessing.Spike}
\title{Remove cosmic rays from the spectra}
\usage{
Preprocessing.Spike(object, device = "CPU", sharpen = 33)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The rammanome class}

\item{device}{Parallel device, default is null for CPU, can be set to "GPU"}

\item{sharpen}{The sharpening factor of the convolution kernel, default is 33}
}
\value{
The Ramanome object with cosmic rays removed spectra, named as "spike.data" in the 'datasets' slot
}
\description{
recognize the cosmic rays by a sharp convolution kernel and replace them with the average of the neighboring pixels
}
\note{
For Windows users: GPU acceleration requires proper installation of OpenCL SDK and GPU drivers.
If you encounter issues with gpuR installation, please refer to the package documentation
or use CPU mode instead.
